This project is private.

It is adjusted for my own purposes and may require other software that is not available to public.

You are allowed to browse and fork the code and use resulting builds for your own, non commercial, purposes.
However, no further rights (e.g. support or the right to publish your own builds) are granted.


This plugin creates a completly, inventory based, physical currency. (That means even furnaces could have a balance)
Also, it hooks into ChestShop to support it. It will not support any other plugins, as it is not Vault compatible.

It was created for the special needs of the Craftlancer.de Minecraftserver.

This plugin is NOT intended to be released on dev.bukkit.org unless there is enough interest.
But it would some require plugins with native support though. ;)
